// Problem Description – Sequential Execution of Async Functions

// You are given an array of asynchronous functions. Your task is to execute them one by one, ensuring that each function starts only after the previous one has completed. 
// The final result should be an array of resolved values in the same order.
async function runSequential(functions) {
    const results = [];

    for (const fn of functions) {
        const result = await fn();
        results.push(result);
    }
